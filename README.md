# Static Site Generator
An app for generating static sites, such as blogs or portfolios. 
This project was created to practice project-building from scratch while learning git, GitHub, and Python.

## How to Use
Honestly this was all just practicing how to move things from text and images on my desktop to a website I could view on the local network.  
I followed the lessons on Boot.dev and put it together in an afternoon. You probably shouldn't use this to try and make a website.  
Use SquareSpace. Make website good.
